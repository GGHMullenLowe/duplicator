# Duplicator

Duplicator makes it painless for content editors to duplicate existing entries, right from within the Statamic Control Panel.

While Duplicator itself is free and doesn't require a license, you can [optionally donate to Duncan](https://duncanm.dev/donate), the developer behind it to show your appreciation.

## Installation

1. Install via Composer - `composer require doublethreedigital/duplicator`
2. Start duplicating!

## Usage

> **ðŸ”¥ Hot Tip:** Make sure you're on the `List` entries view, not the `Tree` one or else you won't see the `Duplicate` button.

1. Go to a Collection, and view the entries listing.
2. Decide on the entry you wish to duplicate. Click the three dots to toggle a dropdown and click the `Duplicate` option.
3. If you've got a multi-site setup, you'll be asked to select the site you wish to duplicate the entry to. Select and option and continue.
4. The entry will then be duplicated!
