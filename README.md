# Duplicator
> Duplicate Entries in Statamic 3

This addon makes it easy for content editors to duplicate existing entries from within the Statamic Control Panel. In the future, hopefully this addon will be updated to support duplicating other things like Blueprints and Assets.

![Addon Demo](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/duplicator/raw/master/demo.gif)

## Installation

1. Install via Composer - `composer require doublethreedigital/duplicator`
2. Start duplicating!

## Usage

To duplicate an entry, go to the Collections page where you can view the entries, click on the three dots

1. Go to a Collection, and view the entries listing.
2. Decide on the entry you wish to duplicate. Click the three dots to toggle a dropdown and click the `Duplicate` option.
3. If you've got a multi-site setup, you'll be asked to select the site you wish to duplicate the entry to. Select and option and continue.
4. The entry will then be duplicated!
