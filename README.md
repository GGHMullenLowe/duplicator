## Duplicator

<!-- /statamic:hide -->

Duplicator makes it painless for content editors to duplicate existing entries & terms, right from within the Statamic Control Panel.

## Installation

First, require Cookie Notice as a Composer dependency:

```
composer require doublethreedigital/duplicator
```

Optionally, you may publish Duplicator's configuration file:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="duplicator-config"
```

Now you can start duplicating!

## Documentation

### Configuration

If you optionally publish the configuration file during installation, it should be present at `config/duplicator.php`. If not, you may publish the config file with the following command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="duplicator-config"
```

The config file looks like this:

```php
<?php

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Defaults
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Set defaults for duplicated entries.
    |
    */

    'defaults' => [
        'published' => true,
    ],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Fingerprint
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Should Duplicator leave a 'fingerprint' on each entry/term/asset it touches
    | so you can tell if it's a duplicated entry or not?
    |
    */

    'fingerprint' => false,

];
```

**Configuration options**

* `defaults` - You can configure defaults for duplicated entries. For example, if duplicated entries should be published or not. If not configured, it will fallback to the status of the entry being duplicated.
* `fingerprint` - Disabled by default. You can choose whether you'd like a 'fingerprint', in the way of an extra `is_duplicate` variable, to be added to entries/terms/assets duplicated by this addon.

### Usage

#### Collection Entries

> **ðŸ”¥ Hot Tip:** Make sure you're on the `List` entries view, not the `Tree` one or else you won't see the `Duplicate` button.

1. Go to a Collection, and view the entries listing.
2. Decide on the entry you wish to duplicate. Click the three dots to toggle a dropdown and click the `Duplicate` option.
3. If you've got a multi-site setup, you'll be asked to select the site you wish to duplicate the entry to. Select and option and continue.
4. The entry will then be duplicated!

#### Taxonomy Terms

1. Go to a Taxonomy, and view the terms listing.
2. Decide on the term you wish to duplicate. Click on the three dots to toggle a dropdown and click the `Duplicate` option.
3. The term will then be duplicated!

### Translations

Thanks to the community, Duplicator provides localized translations in English, French, German & Dutch. If you need translations in another language, you can create them yourself.

First, create the transalation file in `resources/lang/vendor/duplicator/{language}/messages.php`. You should be able to copy the [English translation file](https://github.com/doublethreedigital/duplicator/blob/master/resources/lang/en/messages.php) and make your changes from there.

## Sponsor Duncan

This addon is open-source, meaning anyone can use this addon in their sites for **free**! 

However, maintaining and developing new features for open-source projects can take quite a bit of time. If you're using Duplicator in your production environment, please [consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/duncanmcclean) (Duncan McClean) for a couple dollars a month.


## Security

Only the latest version of Duplicator (v2.0) will receive security updates if a vulnerability is found. 

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to Duncan straight away, [via email](mailto:duncan@doublethree.digital). Please don't report security issues through GitHub Issues.
